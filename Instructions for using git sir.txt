Whenever you first start your work, git pull to get all incoming changes from the main branch.

Sometimes a merge conflict might occur, as the other person might accidentally editted the part you were working on.
1> A merge conflict message will appear, and indicate which file has to be resolved
2> Open the file, the HEAD represents your original work, and the line below shows incoming changes
3> Edit and change wherever the conflict occurs
4> Once all conflicts are resolved, save and type <git -add .>, <git -commit "State message here">, <git -push>
			(adding your changes to your repository) (commiting all changes at your repository) (pushing repo to main branch)


If no merge conflict occurs, just add whichever file you like. When you are done, repeat step 4. If a merge conflict occurs again when you are 
pushing to main branch, just resolve the merge conflict like above.

If you are stuck in the VIM editor, <ctrl s> to save, and type <:wq> + <enter> to quit.
